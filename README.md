# Project 1 Cloud Computing, Part II CST

*Group 2,  consisting of Amaan Hamza, Arvind Raghu and Mathew Blowers*

## Command to run project

After fetching and unzipping the zipped folder, the only command to run is:

`cd WordLetterCount-Group2 & ./run-and-plot.sh`

This script will activate the Python virtual environment, download any module dependencies e.g. `seaborn` for plotting etc., and then run `run-experiments.sh` and `plot-experiments.py` in order, feeding the timestamp output of the former into the latter.

## NOTE:

The scripting was designed for `Python v3.12`, which is the version of Python present on the remote server.
